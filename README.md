# Senior-Project
This repository is my Senior Project for Highschool at IACS. This is a borderless *code editor* developed with **Web Technologies** (HTML, CSS and Javascript), built to run inside of Electron. It features color customizability, syntax highlighting, and custom font choosing among other things.
